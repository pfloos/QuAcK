# Alpha occupations
1 2 3 4 6 
# Beta occupations
1 2 3 4 6

# The numbers indicates occupied orbitlas for the initial guess. The orbitals
# are derived by a ground state calculation with the same maximum-overlap 
# method (MOM) and same number of electrons. 
# Make sure that the occupations are consistent with 
# the method used (e.g. same occupations for alpha and beta in case of MOMRHF)
