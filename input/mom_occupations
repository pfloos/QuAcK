# Beta occupations

# The numbers indicates occupied orbitlas for the initial guess. The orbitals
# are derived by a ground state calculation with the same maximum-overlap 
# method (MOM) and same number of electrons. 
# Make sure that the occupations are consistent with 
# the method used (e.g. same occupations for alpha and beta in case of MOMRHF)
# If the number of alpha and beta electrons is not the same, it is assumed
# in the input that are more alpha than beta electrons.
